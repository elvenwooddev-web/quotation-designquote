# Row Level Security (RLS) Documentation

## Overview

Row Level Security (RLS) has been implemented across all tables in the DesignQuote application to ensure data access is controlled based on user roles and permissions.

**Status:** ✅ **ENABLED** on all tables

## Implementation Date
October 24, 2025

## Key Features

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Uses the existing `roles` and `role_permissions` tables
- **Permission-Driven Policies**: Checks permissions before allowing operations
- **Ownership Model**: Users own their own data (quotes, clients, templates)
- **Hierarchical Access**: Admins and Sales Heads have elevated permissions
- **Audit-Safe**: Revisions tables allow system inserts for tracking

## Helper Functions

The following SQL functions were created to simplify RLS policies:

### 1. `auth_user_id()`
Returns the current authenticated user's UUID from `auth.users`.

```sql
SELECT auth_user_id();
```

### 2. `current_user_profile()`
Returns the complete user profile from the `users` table for the current auth user.

```sql
SELECT * FROM current_user_profile();
```

### 3. `is_admin()`
Checks if the current user has the 'Admin' role and is active.

```sql
SELECT is_admin(); -- Returns true/false
```

### 4. `is_sales_head()`
Checks if the current user has either 'Admin' or 'Sales Head' role and is active.

```sql
SELECT is_sales_head(); -- Returns true/false
```

### 5. `has_permission(resource_name text, permission_type text)`
Checks if the current user has a specific permission on a resource.

```sql
-- Check if user can read quotes
SELECT has_permission('quotes', 'canread');

-- Check if user can create clients
SELECT has_permission('clients', 'cancreate');
```

**Permission Types:**
- `cancreate` - Can create new records
- `canread` - Can view records
- `canedit` - Can update records
- `candelete` - Can delete records
- `canapprove` - Can approve items (quotes)
- `canexport` - Can export data

### 6. `current_user_uuid()`
Returns the current user's UUID from the `users` table (not auth).

```sql
SELECT current_user_uuid();
```

## Database Changes

### New Columns Added

1. **`quotes.createdby`** (UUID)
   - Foreign key to `users(id)`
   - Tracks who created each quote
   - Used for ownership-based access control

2. **`clients.createdby`** (UUID)
   - Foreign key to `users(id)`
   - Tracks who created each client
   - Allows users to manage their own clients

## RLS Policies by Table

### 1. USERS Table

| Policy | Operation | Rule |
|--------|-----------|------|
| `users_select_own` | SELECT | Users can read their own profile |
| `users_select_admin` | SELECT | Sales Heads and Admins can read all users |
| `users_update_own` | UPDATE | Users can update their own profile |
| `users_insert_admin` | INSERT | Only Admins can create users |
| `users_delete_admin` | DELETE | Only Admins can delete users |

**Security Notes:**
- Users cannot see other users' profiles unless they are Sales Head/Admin
- Self-updates prevent privilege escalation

### 2. ROLES & ROLE_PERMISSIONS Tables

| Table | Policy | Operation | Rule |
|-------|--------|-----------|------|
| roles | `roles_select_all` | SELECT | Everyone can read roles (for signup) |
| roles | `roles_insert_admin` | INSERT | Only Admins can create roles |
| roles | `roles_update_admin` | UPDATE | Only Admins can update non-protected roles |
| roles | `roles_delete_admin` | DELETE | Only Admins can delete non-protected roles |
| role_permissions | `role_permissions_select_own` | SELECT | Users see their own permissions + Admins see all |
| role_permissions | `role_permissions_insert_admin` | INSERT | Only Admins can create permissions |
| role_permissions | `role_permissions_update_admin` | UPDATE | Only Admins can update permissions |
| role_permissions | `role_permissions_delete_admin` | DELETE | Only Admins can delete permissions |

**Security Notes:**
- Protected roles cannot be modified or deleted
- Permission viewing is restricted to own role or admin

### 3. CLIENTS Table

| Policy | Operation | Rule |
|--------|-----------|------|
| `clients_select_permission` | SELECT | Users with `canread` on clients resource |
| `clients_insert_permission` | INSERT | Users with `cancreate` on clients resource |
| `clients_update_permission` | UPDATE | Users with `canedit` + (created by them OR is admin) |
| `clients_delete_permission` | DELETE | Users with `candelete` AND is admin |

**Ownership Model:**
- Users can only edit clients they created
- Admins can edit any client
- Deletion is admin-only to prevent data loss

### 4. CLIENT_REVISIONS Table

| Policy | Operation | Rule |
|--------|-----------|------|
| `client_revisions_select_permission` | SELECT | Users with `canread` on clients resource |
| `client_revisions_insert_system` | INSERT | System can create revisions (audit log) |

**Security Notes:**
- Revisions are append-only
- System creates revisions automatically for audit trail

### 5. PRODUCTS & CATEGORIES Tables

| Table | Policy | Operation | Rule |
|-------|--------|-----------|------|
| products/categories | `*_select_permission` | SELECT | Users with `canread` on resource |
| products/categories | `*_insert_permission` | INSERT | Users with `cancreate` on resource |
| products/categories | `*_update_permission` | UPDATE | Users with `canedit` on resource |
| products/categories | `*_delete_permission` | DELETE | Users with `candelete` on resource AND is admin |

**Security Notes:**
- Products are shared across all users who have read access
- Deletion is admin-only to prevent catalog corruption

### 6. QUOTES Table

| Policy | Operation | Rule |
|--------|-----------|------|
| `quotes_select_permission` | SELECT | Has `canread` + (created by user OR is sales head) |
| `quotes_insert_permission` | INSERT | Has `cancreate` on quotes |
| `quotes_update_permission` | UPDATE | Has `canedit` + (own quote OR sales head) + (not approved OR admin) |
| `quotes_delete_permission` | DELETE | Has `candelete` + (own quote OR admin) + (not approved OR admin) |

**Ownership & Approval Rules:**
- Sales Executives can only see/edit their own quotes
- Sales Heads and Admins can see/edit all quotes
- Once approved, only Admins can edit
- Deletion requires ownership or admin role

### 7. QUOTE_ITEMS, QUOTE_REVISIONS, POLICY_CLAUSES Tables

These tables inherit permissions from their parent `quotes` table:

| Table | Policies | Inheritance |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| quote_items | SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE | Based on parent quote permissions |
| quote_revisions | SELECT, INSERT | Read if can read quotes, system inserts |
| policy_clauses | SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE | Based on parent quote permissions |

**Security Notes:**
- Child records follow parent quote access rules
- Revisions are append-only for audit

### 8. PDF_TEMPLATES Table

| Policy | Operation | Rule |
|--------|-----------|------|
| `pdf_templates_select` | SELECT | Public templates OR own templates OR is admin |
| `pdf_templates_insert` | INSERT | All authenticated users |
| `pdf_templates_update` | UPDATE | Template creator OR is admin |
| `pdf_templates_delete` | DELETE | Template creator OR is admin |

**Sharing Model:**
- Templates can be marked as public (`ispublic = true`)
- Private templates visible only to creator and admins
- All users can create templates

### 9. SETTINGS Tables (company_settings, terms_conditions, settings)

| Table | Policy | Operation | Rule |
|-------|--------|-----------|------|
| company_settings | `*_select_all` | SELECT | Everyone can read |
| company_settings | `*_update_admin` | UPDATE | Only Admins can modify |
| terms_conditions | `*_select_all` | SELECT | Everyone can read |
| terms_conditions | `*_update_admin` | UPDATE | Only Admins can modify |
| settings | `*_select_all` | SELECT | Everyone can read |
| settings | `*_insert/update/delete_admin` | INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE | Only Admins can modify |

**Security Notes:**
- Settings are read-only for non-admins
- Global settings affect entire application

## Testing RLS Policies

### Test as Specific User

```sql
-- Switch to a specific user context
SET LOCAL ROLE authenticated;
SET LOCAL "request.jwt.claims" TO '{"sub": "user-auth-uuid-here"}';

-- Test queries
SELECT * FROM quotes;        -- Should see only your quotes
SELECT * FROM clients;       -- Should see clients based on permissions
SELECT * FROM users;         -- Should see only your profile (or all if admin)
```

### Test Permission Checks

```sql
-- Check your permissions
SELECT
  resource,
  cancreate,
  canread,
  canedit,
  candelete,
  canapprove
FROM role_permissions rp
JOIN users u ON u.roleid = rp.roleid
WHERE u.authuserid = auth.uid()::text;

-- Test helper functions
SELECT is_admin();                          -- Am I admin?
SELECT is_sales_head();                     -- Am I sales head?
SELECT has_permission('quotes', 'canread'); -- Can I read quotes?
SELECT current_user_uuid();                 -- My user UUID
```

## API Integration

### Client-Side (Supabase Client)

The client-side Supabase client uses the **anon key** and respects RLS automatically:

```typescript
// lib/db.ts
export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);

// This query automatically filters by RLS
const { data: quotes } = await supabase.from('quotes').select('*');
// User will only see quotes they have permission to view
```

### Server-Side (Admin Client)

The server-side client uses the **service role key** and **bypasses RLS**:

```typescript
// lib/db.ts
export const supabaseAdmin = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseServiceRoleKey);

// ⚠️ WARNING: This bypasses RLS - use carefully!
const { data: allQuotes } = await supabaseAdmin.from('quotes').select('*');
// Returns ALL quotes regardless of user permissions
```

**When to use Admin Client:**
- Creating auth users (`auth.admin.createUser`)
- Background jobs and cron tasks
- Admin operations that require full access
- System-level data modifications

**Security Rule:** NEVER expose admin client to client-side code!

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue: "new row violates row-level security policy"

**Cause:** Trying to insert data without proper permissions

**Solution:**
1. Check user has `cancreate` permission for the resource
2. Verify user's role has correct permissions in `role_permissions`
3. Check if insert policy `WITH CHECK` clause is satisfied

```sql
-- Check user's permissions
SELECT * FROM role_permissions rp
JOIN users u ON u.roleid = rp.roleid
WHERE u.authuserid = 'auth-user-id';
```

### Issue: "Cannot read records - empty result set"

**Cause:** RLS policy filtering out all records

**Solution:**
1. Verify user has `canread` permission
2. Check ownership (for quotes/clients)
3. Verify user is active (`isactive = true`)

```sql
-- Debug: Check current user
SELECT * FROM current_user_profile();

-- Debug: Test permission
SELECT has_permission('quotes', 'canread');
```

### Issue: "Function has_permission does not exist"

**Cause:** Helper functions not created or wrong schema

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Recreate helper functions
-- Run the RLS migration again or check schema
\df has_permission
```

### Issue: "Cannot update approved quote"

**Cause:** RLS policy prevents editing approved quotes (unless admin)

**Solution:**
- Only admins can edit approved quotes
- Unapprove the quote first (if you're admin)
- Or create a new version

### Issue: API route returns empty data but direct SQL works

**Cause:** API route might be using client-side Supabase client without proper auth context

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Ensure auth token is passed to Supabase client
const token = request.headers.get('authorization')?.replace('Bearer ', '');
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser(token);
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Set createdby on Insert

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT
await supabase.from('quotes').insert({
  ...quoteData,
  createdby: currentUserId, // Set ownership
});

// ❌ WRONG
await supabase.from('quotes').insert(quoteData);
// Without createdby, user might not be able to access their own quote!
```

### 2. Check Permissions Before UI Actions

```typescript
import { hasPermission } from '@/lib/permissions';

// Disable button if user lacks permission
const canEdit = hasPermission(permissions, 'quotes', 'canedit');

<Button disabled={!canEdit}>Edit Quote</Button>
```

### 3. Handle RLS Errors Gracefully

```typescript
try {
  await supabase.from('quotes').insert(quoteData);
} catch (error) {
  if (error.message.includes('row-level security')) {
    toast.error('You don not have permission to perform this action');
  } else {
    toast.error('Failed to save quote');
  }
}
```

### 4. Use Admin Client Sparingly

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD - Admin client for admin operation
if (is_admin()) {
  await supabaseAdmin.from('users').delete().eq('id', userId);
}

// ❌ BAD - Using admin client unnecessarily
await supabaseAdmin.from('quotes').select('*');
// Should use regular client to respect RLS
```

### 5. Test with Different Roles

Create test users for each role and verify:
- Admins can do everything
- Sales Heads can approve quotes
- Sales Executives can only see own quotes
- Read-only roles cannot modify data

## Migration Files

The RLS implementation is stored in:
- `supabase/migrations/enable_rls_policies.sql` - Full migration with all policies
- Applied in batches:
  - `enable_rls_policies` - Helper functions and enable RLS
  - `rls_policies_users_roles` - User and role policies
  - `rls_policies_clients_products` - Client and product policies
  - `rls_policies_quotes` - Quote policies
  - `rls_policies_quote_related` - Quote items, revisions, clauses
  - `rls_policies_settings` - Settings tables
  - `rls_grant_permissions` - Grant statements

## Monitoring & Auditing

### View Active Policies

```sql
-- List all policies on a table
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual, with_check
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND tablename = 'quotes';
```

### Check RLS Status

```sql
-- See which tables have RLS enabled
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;
```

### Audit User Actions

```sql
-- View quote revisions
SELECT * FROM quote_revisions
WHERE quoteid = 'quote-uuid'
ORDER BY exported_at DESC;

-- View client changes
SELECT * FROM client_revisions
WHERE client_id = 'client-uuid'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Rollback Plan

If RLS causes issues, you can temporarily disable it:

```sql
-- ⚠️ EMERGENCY ONLY - Disables all security!
ALTER TABLE quotes DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Re-enable when fixed
ALTER TABLE quotes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

**Note:** Never disable RLS in production without a plan to re-enable it!

## Summary
